# scrape-fiddle-config
This is a (Tampermonkey)[https://tampermonkey.net/] script that adds a big, ugly, orange "SCRAPE CONFIG" button to [Fastly Fiddle](https://fiddle.fastlydemo.net/) to capture its configuration components.
Upon clicking said button, the Fiddle's configuration is captured, formatted, and dumped into a new page in your browser.

A Fastly Fiddle:
